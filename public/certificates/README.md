# Certificates Directory

This directory is used to store PDF certificates that can be linked to from the portfolio website.

## Adding Real Certificates

1. Place your PDF certificate files in this directory
2. Use consistent naming like `certificate-name.pdf`
3. Update the certificate URLs in `src/components/sections/Education.tsx`

## Expected Files

Based on the current configuration, the following files should be placed here:

- `machine-learning-cert.pdf` - Machine Learning Specialization Certificate
- `deep-learning-cert.pdf` - Deep Learning Specialization Certificate
- `data-science-cert.pdf` - Data Science Professional Certificate

## File Format

For best results:
- Use PDF format
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB if possible)
- Ensure files are properly named without spaces (use hyphens instead)
