# Meet Ziggy: How I Transformed My Old Gaming Laptop Into a Powerful Home Server

![legion_server_G.png](/images/blogs/legion_server_G.png)
What do you do with a gaming laptop that's no longer your daily driver? Most people would sell it, store it in a closet, or give it away. But I saw an opportunity to give my trusty Lenovo Legion Y530 a second life as a home server. Meet Ziggy — my custom-built home server that's been running for 11 days straight, managing everything from Docker containers to AI models.

## The Hardware Foundation

![open_legion_G.png](/images/blogs/open_legion_G.png)
The Lenovo Legion Y530 might not be the newest kid on the block, but it's surprisingly well-suited for server duties. Originally designed as a gaming laptop, it packs some serious hardware that translates beautifully to server workloads:

### Specifications at a Glance

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5-8300H (8 cores @ 4.00 GHz)
- **Memory**: 7.63 GiB RAM (14% utilized)
- **Storage**: Custom partitioned setup optimized for Docker
- **Graphics**: Dual GPU setup (NVIDIA GTX 1050 Mobile + Intel UHD 630)
- **Network**: Wired Ethernet connection (192.168.1.60/24)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS with Linux 6.8.0-63-generic kernel

The Intel i5-8300H is a quad-core processor with hyperthreading, giving us 8 logical cores. While it may not match modern server processors, it's more than capable of handling multiple containerized services, monitoring tools, and even AI workloads.

## Why Repurpose a Gaming Laptop?

Repurposing a gaming laptop as a server offers several unique advantages:

1. **Built-in UPS**: The laptop's battery acts as an uninterruptible power supply, providing hours of runtime during power outages
2. **Compact Form Factor**: Takes up minimal space compared to traditional tower servers
3. **Integrated Components**: Display, keyboard, and trackpad are built-in for maintenance tasks
4. **Energy Efficient**: Modern laptop components are designed for power efficiency
5. **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes existing hardware instead of purchasing dedicated server equipment

## Custom Disk Partitioning for Docker Workloads

One of the key decisions I made was implementing a custom partitioning scheme optimized for Docker and containerized applications:

```
Disk (/): 22.06 GiB / 39.08 GiB (56%) - ext4
Disk (/home): 5.44 MiB / 29.36 GiB (0%) - ext4  
Disk (/opt/ai-models): 28.00 KiB / 343.44 GiB (0%) - ext4
Disk (/srv): 28.00 KiB / 195.80 GiB (0%) - ext4
Disk (/tmp/ai-cache): 24.00 KiB / 68.35 GiB (0%) - ext4
Disk (/var/lib/docker): 484.00 KiB / 117.56 GiB (0%) - ext4
Disk (/var/log): 688.77 MiB / 14.66 GiB (5%) - ext4
```

This partitioning strategy serves several purposes:

- **/var/lib/docker**: Dedicated 117GB partition for Docker containers and images
- **/opt/ai-models**: Large 343GB partition for storing AI models like Ollama
- **/srv**: Separate 195GB space for application data and services  
- **/tmp/ai-cache**: Dedicated temporary space for AI model caching
- **/var/log**: Isolated logging partition to prevent log files from filling the root partition

## The Software Stack

### Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS: The Foundation

Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS serves as the base operating system, providing:
- **12 years of security updates** (extended from the standard 10 years)
- **Linux kernel 6.8** with enhanced hardware support
- **Improved security features** including AppArmor enhancements
- **Better containerization support** for Docker and Kubernetes workloads

- **Network storage** configuration and management

The beauty of CasaOS lies in its simplicity. Instead of memorizing Docker compose commands or wrestling with configuration files, I can deploy new services with just a few clicks. The dashboard provides instant visibility into system performance, running containers, and available resources.

### Beszel: Lightweight Server Monitoring

![beszel.png](/images/blogs/beszel.png)

For comprehensive monitoring, I chose Beszel — a lightweight alternative to heavier solutions like Grafana or Prometheus. Beszel excels at:

- **Minimal resource footprint** — uses less than 1% CPU during operation
- **Docker container statistics** — tracks CPU, memory, and network usage for each container
- **Historical data** — maintains performance metrics over time
- **Configurable alerts** — notifications for CPU, memory, disk, and temperature thresholds
- **Multi-system support** — can monitor multiple servers from a single hub

The hub-and-agent architecture means I can easily expand monitoring to other devices in my network without complex configuration.

### btop: Terminal-Based System Monitoring

While CasaOS and Beszel provide excellent web-based monitoring, sometimes you need detailed system information directly in the terminal. That's where btop shines:

- **Real-time resource monitoring** with beautiful ASCII graphics
- **Interactive process management** — kill, renice, or inspect processes
- **Customizable themes** and layouts
- **Mouse support** for easy navigation
- **Detailed hardware information** including temperature sensors

btop serves as my go-to tool for troubleshooting performance issues or getting a quick system overview during SSH sessions.

## AI-Powered with Ollama
